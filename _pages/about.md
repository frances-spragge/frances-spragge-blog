I am a DPhil student in the [Foster Lab](https://zoo-kfoster.zoo.ox.ac.uk) at the University of Oxford. I am on the [Interdisciplinary Bioscience DTP](https://www.biodtp.ox.ac.uk) programme (2018-22), funded by the UKRI BBSRC, at Magdalen College. 

Previously, I studied Biological Sciences at Somerville College, University of Oxford (2015-18), and obtained a BA (Hons).
